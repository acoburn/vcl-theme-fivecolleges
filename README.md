vcl-theme-fivecolleges
======================

A bootstrap-based theme for the Apache VCL project.

This theme uses [Twitter-Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) as a starting point for generating the
main CSS files. The *.less files are all included in case there are
further changes desired. The CSS file can be regenerated by issuing the
following command

    $ recess --compress less/bootstrap.less > css/bootstrap.min.css

Recess is a node.js module, and it can be installed like so:

    $ npm install recess -g 

Note: you will need to have node.js and NPM installed

All icons are based on those provided by [Font-Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

All of the template files are located in the 'templates' directory, and
they follow the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io) way of doing
things.
